        <p>This is a fun quiz to find out what type of pet personality you have. Which pet may best suit your lifestyle?</p>
        <p1>Dog personality:Dogs have rightfully earned their reputation as manâ€™s best friend. No matter the size or breed, a dog provides a lifetime of love and loyalty. Dogs are social animals, and they thrive on human companionship. Certain breeds, such as Rottweilers, also make excellent protectors. </p1>
        <p2> Cat personality: Cats are famously low maintenance. They don't need to be bathed or taken for walks. They can be left on their own for hours at a time. Even though cats like to do their own thing, they still need plenty of love and attention. Devote some time each day to playing with your cat, grooming them, or just giving them some TLC.</p2>
