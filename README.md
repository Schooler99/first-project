# Pet Preference? Based on Personality Traits 
Have you ever been frustrated when people ask if you're a dog or cat person, but provide no third option? In this project, we will be providing a quiz to tell you if you are a dog, cat, or reptile/rodent person. Take our number of questions quiz to learn today!

Initial concept 

The idea of the pet preference was that all in our project group loves animals. We decided to do a project based on personality traits. We wanted to research quickly and create a quick quiz. 
We also wanted to test out if someone likes the outdoors, do they have a personality compatable to own a dog? 
If a person is easily stressed out, do they have a personality compatable to own a cat? 
If a person is a nature conservationist, do they have a personality compatable to own a reptile? 



User Story
